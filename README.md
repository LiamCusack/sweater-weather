# README

Sweater-weather is a backend application that allows a user to plan a complete itinerary for a road trip. This include directions to a location, travel times, weather forecast, as well as an image from the chosen area. Weather forecast information proves current weather factors such as the projected time for the sunrise, sunset, actual temperature, felt temperature, humidity, visibility, and conditions. This is true for the next 5 days from your search, as well as hourly updates for the next 8 hours. Weather at the time of arrival to their road-trip destination is also provided. Sweater-weather also includes a fully functional user authentification service, allowing them to choose a password and email they would like to use to create their sweater-weather account. Upon doing so they will be granted a personalized api key that they will use in order to create a Road-Trip. The authentification service ensures that only users with the correct username, password, and api key will be able to access any given account.

This app was the culmination of consuming several different api's and extrapolating the desired date to then return to the user through the app's own api. The API's in use were the Mapquest API, Unsplash API, and Open Weather Map API.
